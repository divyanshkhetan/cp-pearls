## Palindromes

- In case you want to detect a substring which is a palindrome, instead of trying to find palindromes of all lengths, just find the palindromes of lengths 2 or 3. 
  - Why? Think that if we have a palindrome of odd length then after removing the side characters, it always boils down to middle 3 characters. And similarily in case of even lengthed palindrome, it boils down to center 2 characters.
